/**
 * Real-skill trigger measurement.
 *
 * Measures whether an INSTALLED skill wins the queries it should and loses the
 * ones it should not, against its real neighbours. Differs from skill-creator's
 * run-loop.ts in one decisive way, and everything else follows from it:
 *
 *   run-loop.ts installs a synthetic stub in <projectRoot>/.claude/commands/ and
 *   asks whether the router picks THE STUB. Isolating that stub requires the real
 *   skill to be absent -- which, for a plugin-bundled skill, means disabling the
 *   whole plugin and therefore every sibling it ships with. The measurement then
 *   answers "does a lone stub attract these queries in an empty room", when the
 *   question worth answering is "does this skill beat its actual competitors".
 *
 * This runner asks the router directly and reads which skill it chose. Consequences:
 *
 *   - No stub files, so nothing leaks into a real project on interrupt and
 *     concurrent workers cannot shadow one another.
 *   - No config mutation. Nothing is disabled to make room.
 *   - A miss reports WHICH skill won, so a false negative is diagnostic rather
 *     than a tally.
 *   - `--max-turns 1` bounds each call. Triggering IS the first tool call, so
 *     later turns cannot change the verdict; measured 34s -> 16s per call.
 *
 * Reused from skill-creator so the numbers stay comparable: the stratified,
 * seeded train/holdout split, the concurrency pool, and the trigger-rate
 * threshold semantics (a query counts as triggering at rate >= threshold).
 */

/**
 * Borrowed from skill-creator so the numbers stay comparable with RESULTS-baseline.json.
 *
 * The path is absolute and machine-specific, which means this file does not run on a fresh
 * clone. That is deliberate rather than an oversight, and the failure is made loud on purpose:
 * reimplementing the split locally would change which queries land in the holdout, and every
 * number in RESULTS-baseline.json would stop being comparable without anything reporting that
 * it had. A loud import error is cheaper than a quiet incomparability.
 *
 * Override the location with SKILL_CREATOR_DIR if your checkout lives elsewhere.

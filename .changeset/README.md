# Changesets and releases

brain releases the way acmelabs-15/ask-user-question does.

1. A visible change gets a changeset: `bunx changeset`, answer the two prompts, commit the file.
2. On a push to main with pending changesets, the release workflow opens a pull request
   named `ci: Version Packages`. That pull request bumps `package.json`, rewrites
   `CHANGELOG.md`, and runs `version:sync` so every host manifest agrees.
3. Merging it lands a commit with no changesets left. The workflow then cuts the tag
   `v<version>`, a GitHub release carrying that version's changelog section, and moves
   the tag `latest` to the same commit. A pre-release version, one with a hyphen, does
   not move `latest`.

The ACMElabs marketplace entry for brain points at `ref: latest`, so a release reaches
installed users when `latest` moves.
